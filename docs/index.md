## What is this tool about?
GetAltName (or **GAN**) is a tool that extracts sub-domains or virtual domains directly from SSL certificates found in HTTP**S** sites. It returns a handy list of sub-domains to ease the phase of information gathering in a pen-testing assessment where you can find an interesting amount of data.

## What features does it have?

* Returns a list of **unique** subdomains.
* Strip subdomain **wildcards**.
* Removes duplication for **www** subdomains (e.g. example.com and www.example.com)
* Copy the **output directly to clipboard** as a single line string or as a list

## What's to be added in a near future?
- [x] Colors: Because who doesn't like them?
